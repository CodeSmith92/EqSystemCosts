# EqSystemCosts

Python module for extracting annual coal plant generation and related data; for calculating each coal plant's annual operating costs; and for calculating the capital and operational costs of wind and solar power. Relies on data input from EIA-923 (2020). Can be expanded for multi-year comparison.
