# EqSystemCosts

Python module for extracting annual coal plant generation and related data; for calculating each coal plant's annual operating costs; and for calculating the cost of suitable replacement by renewables (wind and solar). Relies on data input from EIA-923 (2020). Can be expanded for multi-year comparison. 

## Updates

* 06/15/2021
> re-uploaded 'CoalCosts.py' which splits the script into a series of functions 

### TODO: 

> update/finish functions in 'RenewableCosts.py'
